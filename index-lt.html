    \u003Ch2>Looking to these papers / greens / bucks from a techy prospective we just realize about today technology limit: no one of us is familiar with papers in the IT world (and sorry for the semplification!) while virtual money like new credit cards and bitcoins got launched and relaunched.\u003C/h2>

Last but not least 8k frames are projected from one end to the other end of the world to build a nice and cool "scenary".\u003C/h2>
