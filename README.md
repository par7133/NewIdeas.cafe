# New Ideas Café
A propositive way to use ideas and collaborate on stuff, in the IT.
   
Hello and welcome in our New Ideas Café!   
   
Please sit at the first free table, seeping from your cup slowly and sharing your new ideas or commenting on the existing ones.  

Join in by asking to become a collaborator.
